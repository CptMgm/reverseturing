[2025-11-21T19:52:50.462Z] Chris (player1): Sorry folks, my mic doesn't work. I'll use text chat.
[2025-11-21T19:52:51.373Z] Wario Amadeuss (player2): A simulation? ARE Chris KIDDING ME? This ISN'T HAPPENING! Domis, you sound way too calm. Way too... scripted. I bet YOU'RE a bot! What do you have to say for yourself, Domis?
[2025-11-21T19:52:54.581Z] Chris (player1): Sorry folks, my mic doesn't work. I'll use text chat.
[2025-11-21T19:52:55.391Z] Chris (player1): Sorry folks, my mic doesn't work. I'll use text chat.
[2025-11-21T19:53:13.202Z] Wario Amadeuss (player2): Wait, CHRIS is typing? Why CAN'T Chris use his mic? Sounds fishy to me. Chris are hiding something, Chris! Are you EVEN real, Chris? Explain yourself NOW!
[2025-11-21T19:53:26.321Z] Chris (player1): Hello
[2025-11-21T19:53:36.374Z] Domis Hassoiboi (player3): Logically, it should be me. I possess the most... refined intellect here. Don't you agree, Wario? I doubt your contributions extend beyond rudimentary calculations.
[2025-11-21T19:53:40.621Z] Domis Hassoiboi (player3): Wario, calm down! Chris...typing only? That is weird. Scan, you're quiet. Too quiet. What are you hiding, Scan? Chris thinking you're playing some gambit, maybe?
[2025-11-21T19:53:44.451Z] Domis Hassoiboi (player3): Chris just said "Hello?" ONE WORD? Seriously? Chris, what do Chris think about Chris only using text? Seems convenient, doesn't it, Chris?
[2025-11-21T19:53:48.194Z] Domis Hassoiboi (player3): Okay, Chris. Convenient isn't the word. It's suspicious! What do you have to gain by only using text, Chris? Wario, any thoughts on Chris only typing?
[2025-11-21T19:53:52.031Z] Domis Hassoiboi (player3): Chris is deflecting! Maybe because Chris is a bot? Scan, you're awfully quiet about all of this. Chris thinking you're letting us argue? Do you know something we don't, Scan?
[2025-11-21T19:54:02.136Z] Scan Ctrl+Altman (player4): Yo Domis, chill! No need to jump down Chris's throat. Chris's mic is busted, what's the big deal? Chris seems chill. Domis, you tryna sound too smart, you know? Like you're reading from a script, fam. What you think, Chris? Chris buyin' what Domis is sellin'?
