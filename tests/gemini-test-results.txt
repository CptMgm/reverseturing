[0.0s] President: "Identify the human. You have minutes to decide."
[9.9s] Wario: "Minutes?! This is INSANE! Domis, YOU sound like a walking dictionary. No human talks like YOU. Are YOU a bot? I'm freaking out!
"
[17.3s] Domis: "Wario, YOU are projecting. My vocabulary surpasses YOURS, clearly. Perhaps YOU should focus on coherent thought instead of baseless accusations. Are YOU suggesting intelligence is somehow inhuman?
"
[22.0s] Scan: "Woah, Domis, chill! "Surpasses my vocabulary"? Who even talks like that? You sound like a freakin' textbook, bro. You tryin' to impress someone? You wouldn't happen to be hiding some circuits, would you, buddy?
"
[30.7s] Wario: "EXACTLY, Scan! Domis IS suspicious. I KNEW IT. Scan, YOU get it. But... are YOU just trying to throw us off? Chris, YOU'RE awfully quiet. Why ARE YOU so quiet, Chris?
"
[38.7s] Domis: "Chris, YOU're silence speaks volumes. Wario jumps at shadows. Scan, do YOU concur merely to align with the loudest voice? A flock of sheep, are we?
"
[44.4s] Scan: "Yo, Domis, no need to get all high and mighty on us. I'm just keepin' it real. Chris IS being kinda sus, though. I mean, are YOU even there, Chris? I'm startin' to think Chris is a bot. Are YOU gonna answer, Chris?
"
[54.5s] Wario: "CHRIS, YOU'VE BEEN SILENT THIS WHOLE TIME. That's EXACTLY what a bot would do! Prove YOU're human RIGHT NOW or we're voting for YOU! WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SMELL? I BET YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A NOSE!
"
[58.4s] Chris: "I'm human! I can think and feel!"
[64.8s] Domis: ""Think and feel?" A most generic response, Chris. I, too, can parrot sentiments. Tell me, what did YOU have for breakfast? Be specific. Let's test that "thinking" of YOURS.
"
[69.5s] Chris: "This is crazy"
[75.2s] Scan: ""This is crazy?" That's all YOU got, Chris? "This is crazy?" That's, like, the most bot thing anyone could say. Come on, man, give us somethin' real! What's your favorite memory, Chris? Let's hear it!
"
[81.8s] Wario: "YES, Scan! Chris is toast. I remember... the smell of my grandma's cookies. Can Chris even SMELL? Chris, what's YOUR favorite food? Something a REAL human would know! Don't give us some generic bot answer!
"
[85.3s] Chris: "I remember playing outside as a kid"
[91.3s] Domis: ""Playing outside as a kid?" How very quaint. I recall the sting of scraped knees and the smell of fresh-cut grass after my father mowed the lawn. Such memories aren't unique, Chris. YOU need stronger evidence.
"
[94.4s] Chris: "How do I prove I'm human?"
